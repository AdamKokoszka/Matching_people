# Matching people

#### Program that lets you choose people in the right order.
>#### Thanks to the database, we have the ability to add and remove users as needed (even in the queue). 
>In a particular week, each person is selected a different person from the database.
When changing the week, pairs of people are also changed.
In the situation when we add a person during the queue, specify the week from which the person should belong,
and the program will match people to be in a 1 to 1 relationship
and so that the pairs of people in previous queues do not coincide with the next ones.
Removing a person consists in selecting a person and approving the action - this will not affect the proper functioning of the program.

Only the **authorized person** has access to the panel. The interface is clear and the logic is simple so that operations on the site do not cause any problems.
